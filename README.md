# AI_mouse.py
This Python script utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a virtual mouse control system. It tracks hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed, mapping index and thumb positions to control the mouse cursor. The script simulates clicks and cursor movement based on hand gestures.
